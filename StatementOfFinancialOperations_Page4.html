        <p class="content-title">Estimates</p>
        <p>
            The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
            management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
            the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
            period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
        </p>
        <p class="content-title">Entities Under Common Control</p>
        <p>
            Management has elected an accounting policy alternative such that, when certain conditions exist, management
            does not apply variable interest entity guidance for assessing whether it should consolidate legal entities under
            common control. The Company has adopted this standard as management believes the presentation of the
            Company‐only financial information is more relevant to the users of the financial statements.

        <p class="content-title">Advertising Costs</p>
        <p>
            Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Such costs were $92,338 and $84,497 respectively, for the years
            ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

        <p class="content-title">Adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326</p>
        <p>
            As of January 1, 2023, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016‐13, Financial
            Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016‐13),
            which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the
            current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology. The CECL model is applicable to the measurement of credit
            losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, including trade and loan receivables, and held to maturity
            debt securities. CECL requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the
            reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.
            The update also requires that credit losses on available‐for‐sale debt securities be presented as an allowance
            rather than a write‐down of the security. This standard provides financial statement users with more decisionuseful
            information about the expected losses on financial instruments.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Company adopted ASU 2016‐13 using the modified retrospective review method for all financial assets
            measured at amortized cost. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2023, are presented under
            Topic 326 while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP.
            The adoption of the new standard did not materially impact the Company’s financial statements.
