    <p>
        The Company elected to be taxed at the entity level rather than the individual shareholder level for certain state
        income taxes. The shareholders will receive a pro rata benefit for the taxes paid by the Company, and
        accordingly, such payments are deemed to be attributable to the owners. Consequently, qualifying tax
        payments made by the Company have been recorded as equity distributions.

    <p class="content-title">Revenue Recognition</p>
    <p>
        For performance obligations related to the sale of tire chains control transfers to the customer at a point in
        time. The Company’s principal terms of sale are FOB destination, and the Company transfers control and records
        revenue for product sales upon delivery to the customer. These products are sold to the automotive and
        trucking industry throughout the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
        The nature of the Company’s business gives rise to variable consideration, including returns that generally
        decrease the transaction price which reduces revenue. These variable amounts are credited to the customer
        based on product returns.
    </p>
    <p>
        Variable consideration is estimated at the most likely amount that is expected to be earned. Estimated amounts
        are included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue
        recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Estimates
        are based on historical experience and known trends.
    </p>
    <p>
        Contract assets include an inventory recovery asset for the cost of expected products returned. Contract assets
        at January 1, 2022 totaled $482,000. Contract liabilities include the estimate of revenue expected to be
        refunded to customers due to returned products. Contract liabilities at January 1, 2022 totaled $878,000.
    </p>
    <p class="content-title">Contract Costs</p>
    <p>
        Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are expensed as incurred as the amortization period of the asset that
        otherwise would have been recognized is estimated to be one year or less.
    </p>
    <p class="content-title">Sales Taxes</p>
    <p>
        Various states impose a sales tax on the Company’s sales to non-exempt customers. The Company collects the
        sales tax from customers and remits the entire amount to each respective state. The Company’s accounting
        policy is to exclude the tax collected and remitted to the states from revenue and cost of revenue earned.
    </p>
    <p class="content-title">Shipping and Handling Costs</p>
    <p>
        Shipping and handling costs are recorded as freight cost of revenue, net of amounts billed to customers for
        freight.
