        Note receivable from shareholders is due in monthly installments of $21,629, carries an interest rate at 2.07%,
        and matures April 2043. The balance of note receivable at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $4,147,032 and
        $4,318,808, respectively. Interest income received on the note receivable for the years ended December 31,
        2023 and 2022 was $87,776 and $91,292, respectively. The Company evaluates the collectability of the balances
        based upon historical experience and the specific circumstances of individual notes, with an allowance for
        uncollectible amounts being provided if necessary. No allowance was necessary as of December 31, 2023 and

    <p class="content-title">Inventory</p>
    <p>
        Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for renewals and improvements that significantly add
        to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and
        repairs are charged to expense. When equipment is retired or sold, the cost and related accumulated
        depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resultant gain or loss is reflected in income.
    </p>
    <p>
        Depreciation is provided using the accelerated cost recovery system and modified accelerated cost recovery
        system, based on useful lives of the assets which range from three to forty years.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Company reviews the carrying value of property and equipment for impairment whenever events and
        circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future
        cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected
        future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which
        the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets. The factors considered by management in performing this
        assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, the manner in which the property is used,
        and the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors. Based on this assessment
        there was no impairment at December 31, {{CurrentYear}} and {{PriorYear}}.

    <p class="content-title">Income Taxes</p>
    <p>
        The Company, with the consent of its shareholders, has elected under the Internal Revenue Code to be taxed as
        an S Corporation. The shareholders of an S Corporation are taxed on their proportionate share of the Company’s
        taxable income. Therefore, no provision or liability for federal income taxes has been included in the financial
        statements. Certain specific deductions and credits flow through the Company to its shareholders.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Company evaluates its tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken on income tax returns
        to determine if an accrual is necessary for uncertain tax positions. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the
        unrecognized tax benefit accrual was zero. The Company will recognize future accrued interest and penalties
        related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense if incurred.
