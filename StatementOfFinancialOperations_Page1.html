    <p>
        The Company sells its products to a broad range of customers throughout the United States. Trade receivables
        due from customers are uncollateralized customer obligations due under trade terms dependent on the time of
        the year in which the order was placed. Pre-season orders receive terms that allow for one third payment at 30
        days, one third payment at 60 days, and the balance at 90 days from the invoice date. Orders placed during the
        season receive 30 day terms. The Company charges interest on overdue customer account balances at a rate of
        1.5% per month. Payments of trade receivables are allocated to the specific invoices identified on the
        customer’s remittance advice or, if unspecified, are applied to the earliest unpaid invoices. Accounts receivable,
        net of allowance for credit losses, at January 1, 2022 was $18,051,604.

        Management believes that the historical loss information it has compiled is a reasonable base on which to
        determine expected credit losses for trade receivables held at December 31, 2023 and 2022 because the
        composition of the trade receivables at those dates are consistent with that used in developing the historical
        credit‐loss percentages. Additionally, management has determined that the current and reasonable and
        supportable forecasted economic conditions are consistent with the economic conditions included in the
        historical information. As a result, the historical loss rates have not been adjusted for differences in current
        conditions or forecasted changes. Accordingly, the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2023 and 2022
        totaled $50,000 and $70,000, respectively. Changes in the allowance for credit losses for receivables are as
        follows for the year ended December 31:
